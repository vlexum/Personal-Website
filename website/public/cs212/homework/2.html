         <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>

         <p>
            Emotional intelligence is the ability to be aware of and manage one’s own emotions including the emotions of others. 
            While many people may not be aware of what emotional intelligence is, it is important for people to be emotionally intelligent. 
            Even though studies show that it is beneficial to learn about emotional intelligence, the modern curriculum has not adapted to these claims. 
            Emotional intelligence is a necessary part of modern education. This curriculum would greatly improve the student’s ability to know and manage
            their emotions along with their ability to empathize and communicate with others.

            Emotions are a very crucial part of life and especially to those who are in school are experiencing many emotions for the first time. According to Daniel Goleman in Emotional Intelligence,
            “the ability to monitor feelings from moment to moment is crucial to psychological insight and self-understanding…People with greater certainty about their feelings are better pilots of their lives” 
            (43). Teaching students how to understand how they feel will lead to better personal decisions on all matters. Not allowing students the opportunity to learn how to interpret how they feel is 
            irresponsible. Knowing how you feel is one thing, but you must also understand how to manage what you feel. Goleman also states, “A sense of self-mastery, of being able to withstand the emotional 
            storms that the buffeting of Fortune brings rather than being “passions slave,” has been praised as a virtue since the time of Plato…The goal is balance not emotional suppression: every feeling has 
            its value and significance”(56). Being able to handle your feelings is a basic emotional skill that will allow students to bounce back from life’s failures and setbacks. Students who can manage emotions 
            will have an easier time in school and eventually in the rest of life as they grow up. The large list of crucial benefits from teaching students how to recognize and manage their emotions offers no reason
            to why it should not be a part of modern education.

            Emotional intelligence does not stop at recognizing your own emotions, you must also have the ability to also recognize the emotions of the people around you. As Goleman notes, 
            “People who are empathetic are more attuned to the subtle social signals that indicate what others want or need” (43). Knowing how others feel is just as important to knowing how you 
            feel, especially since emotions are rarely put into words. The ability to know how others feel comes into play in the vast majority of life, making it something that is valuable to
            teach students. It also plays hand in hand in your ability to communicate with the people around you.  Goleman states that, “social abilities allow one to shape an encounter, to 
            mobilize and inspire others, to thrive in intimate relationships, and to persuade and influence, to put others at ease” (113). The majority of the people you meet in your early life
            are from your school, why not include in the curriculum how to obtain and maintain relationships with their peers. Teaching students how to relate and communicate with their peers may 
            also solve many of the personal problems that socially incompetent people face. Education stands to prepare students for their life, yet the modern curriculum fails to recognize the 
            importance of emotional intelligence. 
         </p>

         <p>
            It is time that school systems recognize the necessity of teaching students about emotional intelligence. Children are being taught various things that they will never use in their daily lives,
            but not how to deal with their emotions, which is something that everyone deals with every moment of their life. Teaching students of emotional intelligence is a necessary part of a modern curriculum.
            Being taught at a young age about these concepts serves to create a better society where everyone can understand and manage their feelings along with people that surround them.
